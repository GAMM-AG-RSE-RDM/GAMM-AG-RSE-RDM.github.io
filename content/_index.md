# GAMM Activity Group on Research Software Engineering and Research Data Management in Mathematics & Mechanics

The development of research software and the handling of research data has been essential for many areas within the fields of the GAMM for decades and ranges from simulation scripts and data to accompany publications to extensive software libraries and petabytes of data for specific application areas.

As the GAMM Activity Group on Research Software Engineering and Research Data Management in Mathematics & Mechanics (GAMM FA RSE&RDM), we aim at making a contribution here by providing impetus from the perspective of computer-driven sciences. We want to give the GAMM activities in the areas of research data and research software a visible home and promote synergies in the scientific exchange between the activities groups and identify GAMM-specific infrastructure requirements and fields of action.
