The Helmholtz Joint Lab "Helmholtz Information - Research Software Engineering" ([HiRSE](https://www.helmholtz-hirse.de/)) aims at establishing both central RSE activities and targeted sustainable funding of strategically important codes by so-called Community Software Infrastructure (CSI) groups within the Helmholtz research field [Information](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/research-fields/information/). In addition, HiRSE is well integrated into national RSE activities, contributing to RSE events and running the [HiRSE Seminar Series](https://www.helmholtz-hirse.de/series.html).

# MPG-RSE

This group of active RSEs in the Max Planck society is currently in the process of creating a plattform for exchange and visibility among RSEs across the Max Planck society. They are working closely with the RDM activities, especially the [Max Planck Digital Library](https://mpdl.mpg.de), to address the cross cutting topics related to software and data.

# NFDI@MPG

This internal working group was established by the President of the Max Planck Society and is led by Erwin Laure ([MPCDF](https://www.mpcdf.mpg.de/)) and Peter Benner ([MPI DCTS](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de)). It coordinates the activities of Max Planck researchers within the [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de). The group fosters active exchange between Max Planck institutes and NFDI consortia at annual workshops.
